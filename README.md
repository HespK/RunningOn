# RunningMate


An Android demo app that matches music speed to the runner's pace using an IMU sensor.

The wearable is a Photon Arduino based device from which accelerometer/IMU data is collected on the ankle. Once the data is processed, Music control is mapped to the runner's cadence allowing them to switch between slow, medium and fast paced songs in their playlist automatically.
